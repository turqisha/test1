                 <dd>HTML 3.2 was published as a  <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C_Recommendation" target="blank">W3C_Recommendation</a> It was the first version developed and standardized esclusively by the W3C, <br>
                    as the UETF had closed its HTML working group on september 12, 1996. Initialy code-named "Wilbur",HTML 3.2 dropped math <br>
                    formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink <br>
                    edelent and <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft" target="blank">Microsoft's <sup>(6)</sup></a> marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies. A markup for mathematical formulas <br>
                    similar to that of HTML was standardized 14 months later in Mathml.

                    <i>focusing on a single definitive standart, which is considered a "snapshot" by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization will</i> <br>
                    <i>continiue its work with HTML5 as a "Living standart".</i> <br>
